Configure PylanceðŸ”—

With the default configurations, you will get support for autocompletion, but Pylance might not check for type errors.

You can enable type error checks from Pylance with these steps:
    Open the "User Settings"
    Search for Type Checking Mode
    You will find an option under Python â€º Analysis: Type Checking Mode
    Set it to basic or strict (by default it's off)
